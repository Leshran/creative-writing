* Fork the Project
* Create a branch formatted as ``task/LastnameFirstname``. For example, for poetry use:
``git checkout poetry/BoussifOussama``, for story, use ``git checkout story/BoussifOussama``
* Commit your Changes ``git commit -m 'Your commit message'``
* Push to the Branch ``git push origin task/LastnameFirstname``
* Open a Pull Request

Make sure to commit a directory with your name for each task. When committing your code to the poetry task, put all your files in a folder named ``LastnameFirstname``, in this case ``BoussifOussama``. Hence the project structure would be as follows:

```
.
+-- poetry
|   +-- BoussifOussama
|       +-- yourfile.py
|       +-- data.txt
|       +-- notebook.ipynb
|       ...
+-- story
|   +-- BoussifOussama
|       +-- yourfile.py
|       +-- data.txt
|       +-- notebook.ipynb
|       ...
...
```
